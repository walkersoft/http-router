# Fusion.Router

A routing package that maps URL endpoints with assigned Route objects.  These objects then dictate
what action after a match occurs.  Matches are based on the URL content and the incoming HTTP
request method.

_Note: This project is abandoned. Use an alternative package for new and existing projects.
